# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

Using Kickstarter dataset, analyzed theater musicals across multiple countries to assess outcome of campaign based on launch date and fundraising goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

**Analysis**

Findings show that the Most Successul outcomes based on launch date come in May and June. These months also have the largest amount of total campaign launches. Failed launches by month do not show a significant trend, as there was little variation month over month for failed campnes. The Lowest month being November at 31 campaigns and May at 52.

Findings show that the lowest fundraising goal has the most chance of successful outcomes, less than $1000 haveing a 76% chance to meet goal. However the findings also show 35000-49999 goals had a 67% chance of being successful. Once a campaign goal reach $15,000 or higher, they were more likely to fail than succeed.

**Challenges**

While the $35,000-$399999 and $40,000-$44,999 had a larger successful rate, the total number of projects were 6 and 3, respectively. This is not a large enough sample size to be statistically significant, thus presenting a challange to analysis. 

Outcomes based on launch date was viewed by month, but not in a year over year comparison. Analysis for successful or failed campaigns year over year by month is a limitation to the results due to the ambiguity of client parameters.

##Results

1. The best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign is in the summer. The most successful months are May-July, but this is also the most popular time to launch. 
2. The worst time to launch a Kickstarter campaign is October and December. There is a 43-47% chance of failure compaired to other months ranging 31-38%. 
3. Based on funding goals, the lower the monetary amount requested, the higher likelihood there is of a successful campaign. 
4. Any goals $15,000 or greater have at least a 50% chance of failure. It is recommended to keep campaing funding goals below $15,000. 

##Limitations

There are several limitations to this dataset. First, there is a signifcantly lower number of campaings over $10,000 compared to under $10,000 which may have skewed results due to small data set. Second, theater outcomes based on launch date was analyzed across all participating countries. This dataset my be too large to accurately depict outcomes in client's country.

It is recommended that an additional table be added to outcomes based on launch date that included percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns. This would better visually represent chances of success to the client. It is also recommended that both outcomes tabs add an additional graph showing outcomes only in client's country to better reflect chances of success for the client.
